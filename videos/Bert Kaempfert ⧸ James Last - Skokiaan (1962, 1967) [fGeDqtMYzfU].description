A comparison of two versions of the song Skokiaan as recorded by two German bandleaders, Bert Kaempfert and James Last. The song was composed by Zimbabwean musician August Musawurwa, and became a worldwide hit in the 1950s. Kaempfert recorded his version in 1962 for his African-influenced album A Swingin' Safari, while Last recorded his version in 1967 for his album Trumpet รก gogo 2. Both bandleaders used Hamburg studio musicians for their recordings, so both tracks have some of the same players on them.
